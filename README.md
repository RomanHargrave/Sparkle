# Sparkle

Sparkle is (another) XML DSL for Scala inpsired by
[glitter](https://github.com/julienrf/glitter); however, unlike glitter,
sparkle uses Scala's XML support as the underlying XML representation.

The intention behind sparkle is the create an XML AST syntax more
syntactically native to Scala than embedded XML, while remaining fully
compatible with embedded XML. Sparkle is not guaranteed to be fully
compatible with glitter, but takes design inspiration from glitter.
